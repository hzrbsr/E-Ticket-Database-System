# 🎫 E-Ticket Database Management System (MSSQL)

A high-performance, scalable, and professional database schema designed for electronic ticketing systems. This project supports various event types including concerts, sports, theater, and transportation (flights/trains).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Robust Schema:** Optimized relations between Users, Events, Venues, and Bookings.
- **Automated Inventory:** Integrated **SQL Triggers** that automatically update seat availability upon ticket purchase or cancellation.
- **Secure Transactions:** **Stored Procedures** manage the booking logic to ensure data integrity and prevent double-booking (Race Conditions).
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive tracking of ticket scans, status changes, and entry logs.
- **Flexible Pricing:** Support for multiple pricing tiers (VIP, Standard, Economy) per event.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
- **Language:** T-SQL (Transact-SQL)
- **Concepts:** Triggers, Stored Procedures, Views, Foreign Key Constraints, and Indexing.

## 📊 Database Architecture



The system architecture is designed to handle high-concurrency environments with a focus on data normalization and query performance.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `/scripts/schema.sql`: Core table structures and constraints.
- `/scripts/procedures.sql`: Business logic (Booking, Validation, Cancellation).
- `/scripts/triggers.sql`: Automation for inventory and logging.
- `/diagrams/`: ER Diagram visualizations.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. Create a new database: `CREATE DATABASE ETicketDB;`.
3. Execute the `schema.sql` script to build the architecture.
4. (Optional) Run `sample_data.sql` to populate the system with test events and users.

## 📝 Example Query: Checking Event Availability

```sql
SELECT event_name, venue_name, available_seats 
FROM vw_active_events 
WHERE city = 'London';
